        <p class="intro">Kerry TJ Logistics was formerly known as T-Join logistics Ltd., which mainly provided domestic
          shipping and
          logistics services in Taiwan. In addition to serving clients in urban and rural areas, T-Join logistics Ltd.
          also provided shipping support for agricultural producers in remote areas. Established in 1954, T-Join grew
          over six decades to establish service stations and routes covering all of Taiwan, including the offshore
          islands of Penghu and Kinmen. Today, Kerry TJ Logistics has over 4,000 employees and 3,000 vehicles, making us
          one of the most important providers of logistics services in Taiwan.</p>
        <p class="intro dis_none">Since its joint venture with Hong Kong’s Kerry Group in 2008, the business scope of
          Kerry TJ
          Logistics has expanded to include less-than-truckload (LTL) deliveries, ambient temperature logistics
          services, and low temperature warehousing and distribution. In recent years, it has even expanded to include
          pharmaceutical logistics, building a quality brand and being recognized and valued by a broad client group.
          Based on a logistics network across 40 countries worldwide, Kerry TJ Logistics has constructed a diversified
          service platform. In addition, the company has integrated resources to provide clients in the Greater China
          region with one-stop services. Kerry TJ Logistics' highly reliable and flexible logistics' service is a unique
          advantage of the company.</p>
        <p class="intro dis_none">Transportation Services
          Kerry TJ Logistics began in transportation services. Through the design of regular dispatch and precise
          planning of long-distance services, Kerry TJ Logistics constructed freight transportation Hub-and-Spoke
          Network with pickups at satellite stations to effectively and timely complete consignments and provide
          Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) services. So far, nearly 150 service locations have
          been established, including transit centers, operations offices and goods collection stations. This complete
          transportation network provides clients with a strong base of professional services.
        </p>
        <p class="intro dis_none">Logistics Services(including ambient and low temperature storage & distribution)
          Logistics services are another core business of Kerry TJ Logistics. Aside from professional storage
          management, we strive to meet clients’ need in additional services such as devanning, warehousing, sorting,
          retrieving, disposal and customized value added services. Kerry TJ Logistics provides a range of logistics
          services based on client needs, adopting top of the line equipment such as an Automated Storage/Retrieval
          System (AS/RS) and has established highly efficient multi-temperature logistics centers.
          Cold storage and temperature controlled distribution is a key service provided by our logistics center. Unlike
          our competitors, Kerry TJ Logistics provides multi-temperature controlled storage: chilled (4°C), frozen
          (-18°C) and deep frozen (-25°C). In addition, to ensure the quality of cold storage services, Kerry TJ
          logistics invests in Kerry Cold Chain Equipment Company Limited that is an agent for Carrier Air Conditioning
          in Taiwan, providing the equipment for our refrigerated storage and distribution vehicles, making us the only
          logistics firm in Taiwan to offer multiple levels of temperature control and cryogenic refrigeration
          technology.</p>
        <p class="intro dis_none">Sea and Air Transport, and Customs Services
          In order to provide one-stop services, the Kerry Group's Kerry Speedy Logistics Co. Ltd. is responsible for
          sea and air freight business. Through the platform of the Kerry Group, services such as international freight
          forwarding, sea freight, air freight, sea and air joint freight, customs clearance and courier services are
          provided. Container freight stations have also been established to handle the receipt, transport, assembly and
          disassembly of import and export goods. Kerry Freight has set up service locations in Taipei and Kaohsiung to
          handle customs declaration and clearance of import and export goods. Through this cooperation, Kerry TJ
          Logistics’ integrated logistics services in the freight forwarding and customs declaration segments have been
          enhanced.</p>
